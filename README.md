# Ironhack Project 1 - Program a game

During our WebDev full-time course at Ironhack São Paulo we have to, as our first project, come up and program a game. I chose to make a game that combines the game-style of snakes & ladders with some unique moments of one of my favorite movie, Harold & Kumar go to white castle. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine so that you can enjoy it. It still has LOADS of room for improvement and ideas, but i hope it will already make you laugh a couple of times.

### Prerequisites

You will need a web browser with at least the following versions:
- Chrome 55
- Firefox 50
- Safari 10
- Opera 42
- Edge 16

This game has been optimized for a computer with a 15,4-inch (2880 x 1800) resolution. 

The game is not adapted fot the mobile phone yet.

### Installing

You just want to play already? Just click the following link: https://raphaelhuber.github.io/Ironhack-Project1/Main/index

If you prefer having the game content on your computer and play it from there please follow the following steps.

1. Downlaod the zipped Ironhack-Project1-master file
2. Unzip the file

### Opening and starting the game
##### Opening

1. Double click on the unzipped Ironhack-Project1-master folder
2. Double click on the Main folder
3. Double click the index.html file
4. You should be seeing a foto of the Harold & Kumar go to white castle movie cover.

##### Sarting the game

To start the game you just have to click the "Play" button in the center top of the screen. Enjoy!

## How to play the game

To play this game you just need your mouse. After you clicked the 'Play' button you will find the game-board and a 'Roll the dice' button. Each turn you will roll the dice by clicking this button. It will display you the amount you diced and will automatically move forward accordingly. Once your character stops on a tile it will display the event of the tile and display its content and what will happen once you confirm by clicking the appearing 'Ok' button under the event text (the event images might take a couple of seconds to charge, sorry for that). These events will either make you go further in front, go back or stay where you are. Your character will only move once you have clicked this 'Ok' button.

## Goal of the game

The goal of the game is simple. Make it all the way up the tiles and pass OVER the tile 39 to win and get these well deserved and delicious white castle burgers. 

Good luck!

## For the thursty (and over 18) ones

You can easily change this game to any kind of drinking game. E.g. by relating the number of tiles you might have to go back to sips of pieces of clothing. I am working on adding a multiplayer mode and respective icons (Harold, Kumar, Goldstein and Rosenberg) but for now you will have to play as one team.
